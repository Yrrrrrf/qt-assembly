feat(x86): add boolean parsing script and fix bugs

This commit introduces a new assembly script `2x-05-parse-bool.asm` that parses a boolean value from the command-line arguments.

The script includes the following features:
- Parsing of boolean flags like `true`/`false`, `on`/`off`, `1`/`0`.
- Case-insensitive comparison.
- Prints the parsed boolean value.

This commit also fixes a "short jump out of range" build error by restructuring the code, and a bug in the string comparison logic where the source string pointer was not being reset.

Finally, this commit removes the temporary file `commit_msg.tmp`.
