feat(x86): add hexadecimal parsing script and fix build

This commit introduces a new assembly script `2x-04-parse-hex.asm` that parses a hexadecimal number from the command-line arguments.

The script includes the following features:
- Parsing of a string representation of a hexadecimal number from the command line.
- Handling of an optional leading "0x".
- Conversion of the ASCII string to a 16-bit integer.
- Printing the decimal representation of the number.

This commit also fixes a "short jump out of range" build error that was present in the previous commit by restructuring the code.

Finally, this commit removes the temporary file `commit_msg.tmp`.
