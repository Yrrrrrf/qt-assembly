feat(x86): add signed 16-bit integer parsing script

This commit introduces a new assembly script `2x-03-parse-i16.asm` that parses a signed 16-bit integer from the command-line arguments.

The script includes the following features:
- Parsing of a string representation of a number from the command line.
- Handling of an optional leading '-' for negative numbers.
- Conversion of the ASCII string to a 16-bit integer.
- Printing the decimal representation of the number.
